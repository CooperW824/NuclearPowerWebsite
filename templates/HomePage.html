		<h3> What is Nuclear Power?</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Nuclear Power is an alternative electricity source than that of burning Fossil Fuels</li><br>
			<li>Nuclear Power as we know it today uses a Fission Reaction of Uraniume</li><br>
			<li>Nuclear Fission was originally harnessed by humans in 1938 when Enrico Fermi discovered that bombarding uranium split the atom into two elements that were about half the mass of Uranium</li>
			<li>Carbon Dioxide (CO2 (common greenhouse gas)) levels have gone up by ~35 ppm since 2005</li><br>
			<li>Nuclear fission was then used to develop the Atom Bomb for WW2, from this, discoveries like chain nuclear reactions and neutron blocking materials were invented, making not only the bomb possible, but nuclear power too.</li><br>
			<li>During the Cold war Nuclear Power was developed alongside of nuclear bombs, making a much cleaner form of energy.</li><br>
			<li>There have been a total of 7 incidents since Enrico Fermi split Uranium we will talk about 3 of the most influential </li><br>
			<li>In 1978 in Middletown Pennsylvania, the largest Nuclear Disaster in US history occurred, where one of the reactors had a partial meltdown leaking radiation into the surrounding environment. </li><br>
			<li>In 1986, in Ukraine, the worlds worst nuclear disaster happened at Chernobyl, where a reactor had a sudden spike in power in reactor 4 during maintenance, made it so that it exploded, the radiation released made it so that 220,000 had to be relocated.</li><br>
			<li>In 2011, in Fukushima Japan, the most recent nuclear disaster happened, where a tsunami destroyed the reactor safety systems causing hydrogen to build in the reactor, making it explode releasing radiation and forcing 500,000 to evacuate.  </li><br>
			<li>Now, Nuclear Energy is the safest it has ever been, and it makes up 20% of overall US electricity production.</li><br>

		<h2>How does nuclear Power Work?</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>Nuclear Power works by controllably splitting Uranium-235</li><br>
			<li>This happens in a chain reaction, where a neutron splits the Uranium, releasing energy, more neutrons and waste elements.</li><br>
			<li>We can control the reaction using control rods which absorb Neutrons to keep the reaction slow</li><br>
			<li>The Energy generated from the reaction is in the form of thermal energy also known as heat, we use that heat to heat up water into steam to spin a turbine</li><br>
			<li>The heat is transferred through a closed cycle heat exchanger meaning the water used to cool the reactor is NOT radioactive</li><br>
			<li>After the steam is used to spin a turbine, it is condensed into a liquid from another water line leading to a cooling tower, and is recycled back into the reactor</li><br>
			<li>This ensures that absolutely none of the water released from nuclear power plants is radioactive.</li><br>
