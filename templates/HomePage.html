		<h3> What is global Warming? </h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Global warming is the slow increase of global temperatures, caused by greenhouse gasses </li>
			<li>Greenhouse gasses are emitted from factories and agriculture</li>
			<li>These gasses reflect heat onto the earth as a greenhouse would</li>
		</ul>
		<hr width = "960px" align = "left">
		<h3> Facts about global warming </h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Carbon Dioxide (CO2 (common greenhouse gas)) levels have gone up by ~35 ppm since 2005</li>
			<li>The temperature has gone up 1.9<sup>O</sup>f since 1880</li>
			<li>Polar ice has gone down 12.85% every decade on average</li>
			<li>Resulting in 427 gigatons of ice lost each year </li>
		</ul>

		<h3>How this will affect evolution</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>In certain areas, it will help by lengthening growing seasons</li>
			<li>In other areas, it could kill vegetation in those areas</li>
			<li>Certain coastal areas will be vulnerable to more hurricanes</li>
			<li>Midwest could be subject to more tornadoes</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>How does nuclear Power Work?</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>As the planet warms, scientists project 1.8 â€“ 5.4<sup>0</sup>f of warming will extend growth periods in certain areas</li>
			<li>Other areas will become so dry it will have limited water and nutrients in the soil</li>
			<li>Plants will have to evolve so that they either become smaller to be able to grow and spread their seeds </li>
			<li>Evolve to be bigger to be able to produce more seed to take advantage of the extended growing season</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Evolution Examples</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Mustard plants during the 2004 California droughts had evolved to produce flowers earlier </li>
			<li>Mustard plants also grew smaller and would produce fewer flowers </li>
			<li>Plants like thyme are now growing in what would usually be colder areas as the areas are getting warmer</li>
			<li>Thyme produces oils  and because of that the plant is less resistant to freezing so the warmer climate means they can live farther north or south</li>
