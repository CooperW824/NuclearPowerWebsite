		<h3> Animal Adaptations </h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Nuclear Power, releases little Carbon Dioxide or other greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere meaning it has a negligible effect on global warming</li><br>
			<li>When compared to producing the same amount of power burning coal does nuclear power saves 490 million tonnes of Carbon Dioxide pollution from the atmosphere</li><br>
			<li>Nuclear Power takes less space as compared to burning fossil fuels as the reaction is much more efficient</li><br>
			<li>Nuclear Power does not emit NO or SO2 meaning no acid rain is generated from it, unlike that of burning fossil fuels</li><br>
			<li>The discharge water from the cooling of the power plant or from the water that is boiled for turbines, is clean water without any dangerous metals as compared to fossil fuels that release dangerous metals into the water</li><br>
			<li>The water released is also cooler temperature wise, which is better for the local ecosystem as warm water does not let oxygen dissolve as easily, and so fish can suffocate without the oxygen. </li><br>
