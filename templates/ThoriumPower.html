		<h3> How Will humans Evolve </h3>
		<ul>
			<li>People often think humans are done evolving, but thatâ€™s not true</li>
			<li>A warmer climate means more of a likelihood of diseases like Malaria and West Nile Disease</li>
			<li>As these diseases proliferate, conditions like sickle cell may become more prevalent as one copy of the genes is good for fighting malaria</li>
			<li>Our digestive system and microbiome will evolve too as eventually, our diet will change from primary meat-eating to vegetarian. </li>
			<li>As land to grow food shrinks, people will ultimately be forced to fall closer to the vegetarian side of the spectrum</li>
			<li>And people have already seen how vegetarians also have far different microbiomes than omnivorous humans </li>
			<li>We could see a rise in mass migrations from coastal areas and areas near the equator</li>
			<li>This could mean having more mixed-race children, which could eventually populate throughout humans.</li>

		<h2>Climate Change Effect on Evolutionary Rates</h2>

		<h3>Evolutionary Rates</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Evolutionary rated is dependent on 2 things:</li>
			<li>The likelihood of a change to the genome</li>
			<li>And the population's ability to overcome koinophilia</li>
			<li>Koinophilia is the instinct of an animal to not breed with an animal that has observable changes to their DNA or mutations</li>
			<li>In extreme circumstances, both of these can change so that the animal can quickly change to evolve for its environment</li>
			<li>The likelihood of genetic change is raised meaning more animals are changing </li>
			<li>And koinophilia decreases towards those with favorable traits </li>
			<li>A changing climate is one of those extreme circumstances and so we would probably see more animals changing and changing faster so the evolutionary rates will increase</li>
